# 3xhaustPi

Semantic-only coding runtime and black event-driven TUI used by 3xhaustPi.

```bash
npm install -g 3xhaustpi
3xhaustpi auth login openai-codex
3xhaustpi
```

The package exports the shared Electron/CLI runtime as `3xhaustpi/runtime`.
The model emits bounded intent and patch proposals; the host owns actual
capability names, paths, permissions, timeouts, revisions, and execution.
Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux
Secret Service; the local mode-0600 file contains non-secret metadata only.

This package build is `3xhaustpi@0.1.9`. It has passed local `npm pack`, isolated global
install, real-provider coding, crash-resume, and a five-case, 50-pair
real-provider benchmark with 98% semantic-only and 100% direct-tool
provider-reported warm cache-hit requests. Capability success and model-output
validity were 100% in both arms. No publish is performed by build or test commands.

The TUI starts the coding runtime worker on the first task and reuses it across
normal sequential turns. Cancellation and exit reap the worker process tree.
Idle redraw is event-driven; only active-work shimmer uses a 120 ms timer.
An actual `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra` task completed through this boundary.

External-app Computer Use ships platform adapters for macOS System Events,
Windows UI Automation, and Linux AT-SPI 2 behind one semantic role/name and
observation-digest policy. Windows/Linux protocol fixtures pass locally, and a
linux-arm64 and linux-x64 native archives completed an actual GTK 3 `Run` to
`Completed` accessibility action on Ubuntu 24.04; the x64 bundled Node reported
`linux/x64`. Windows target execution remains unverified.

See the repository README for the full user guide, benchmark receipt, native
archives, update verification, and exact unsupported scope.
